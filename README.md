# Solar System Simulation

This project is a 3D simulation of the solar system, built using OpenGL with GLFW and GLM for graphics rendering and math operations. The simulation demonstrates textures, animations, transformations, materials, lighting, and free movement/rotation to explore the scene. It is designed to be run on Microsoft Visual Studio 2022, and you can interact with the solar system to explore different celestial bodies like the Sun, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and other planets and moons.

## Features

- **Textures**: Each planet, moon, and the Sun is mapped with a realistic texture to provide an immersive experience.
- **Animation**: The planets rotate around the Sun and the moons rotate around their respective planets.
- **Lighting**: The simulation includes basic lighting to enhance the 3D visualization.
- **Movement/Rotation**: You can freely move using WSAD and QE.

## Technologies Used

- **OpenGL**: For rendering the 3D graphics and visualizing the solar system.
- **GLFW**: For windowing, handling user input, and managing the OpenGL context.
- **GLM**: A math library for OpenGL, used for transformations, camera movements, and matrix calculations.
- **C++**: The main programming language for the simulation.
- **Microsoft Visual Studio 2022**: The IDE used for development.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. **Microsoft Visual Studio 2022**: Download and install Visual Studio from [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).
2. **GLFW**: The project uses GLFW for handling windows and input. You can download it from [GLFW's website](https://www.glfw.org/download.html).
3. **GLM**: This project uses GLM for math operations. You can download it from [GLM's GitHub repository](https://github.com/g-truc/glm).
